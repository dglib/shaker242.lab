# Configuring Jenkins for Docker Enterprise Edition
*The unofficial Guide :D*

This is a repository to configure a fully functioning Jenkins CICD environment running on top of Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE 2.0). There is a example documentation for both Swarm Mode and Kubernetes as the Orchestrator layer within Docker EE. This documentation assumes you have a fully functioning Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).

For demonstrations, this repo is linked with https://github.com/ollypom/ee-demo-app

Instructions for Swarm can be found here:
